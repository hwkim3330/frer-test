# FRER Test Setup Status

## Physical Connections
- PC enp2s0 (10.0.100.2) → Unknown board connection
- PC enp11s0 (169.254.13.30) → SSH Board eth0 (169.254.100.2) [Management]
- Serial Console (/dev/ttyUSB0) → One of the boards

## Current Configuration

### Serial Board (via /dev/ttyUSB0)
- Bridge: br0 with VLAN filtering
- VLAN 10: All ports configured
- eth3: Shows high RX traffic (likely PC connection)
- VCAP: Rule 1001 configured for ISDX=1
- FRER: iflow 1 with generation to eth1/eth2

### SSH Board (169.254.100.2) 
- Not responding to SSH commands properly
- Previously configured as receiver

## Issues Found
1. SSH board commands not executing properly
2. Need to identify which physical board is which
3. FRER statistics showing no traffic

## Next Steps
1. Use serial console to complete configuration
2. Generate test traffic directly
3. Monitor FRER statistics on serial board
